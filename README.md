******************** About the three files in the project folder ********************

01.     In the project folder there are three files named as App.js, ToDoItems.js and runOnMobile.png

02.     App.js is the main file wich contains the styles for the main interfce and it inclueds
        all the scripts that are necessary to run this project. 

03.     ToDoItems.js is the file which contains styles for to do items. I have created todo
        items separately and imported it to the App.js file.

04.     So please make sure to add those two files (App.js and ToDoItems.js) into the same directory
        whenever this project is tested.

05.     In case if the project doesn't work properly make sure to add the dependencies
        by clicking "add dependencies".

06.     runOnMobile.png is a screenshot of how the app looks which I took by testing the app on
        Expo mobile client.
